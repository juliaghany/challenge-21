## Description 

This project focuses on refactoring an existing codebase to improve the efficiency, scalability, and maintainability of the application. In order to accomplish this, I rebuilt the Google Books API search engine to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. In order to fulfill this challenge, I had to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. I also had to modify the existing authentication middleware so that it worked in the context of a GraphQL API. Lastly, I had to create an Apollo Provider so that requests coud communicate with an Apollo Server.
